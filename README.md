# Movie Search

A Project I worked on in my "Programming Concepts and Methods" class at California State University. 

In this project, I use the Java Programming Language to tokenize the contents in "db.txt" to enable the user to search a movie by actor, year, runtime, director and title.

This program also allows users to create a new entry as well as delete any existing ones. These changes will be written in the "db.txt" file to ensure information is saved.

## Requirements
An IDE that can run java files such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse.

## Controls
When running the program, the console will list a menu of options for the user to select from. The list is as follows.

a) New Entry 

b) Search by actor

c) Search by year

d) Search by runtime

e) Search by director

f) Search by title

g) Delete Entry 

h) Quit
